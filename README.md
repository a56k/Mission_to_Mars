# Mission_to_Mars
Automate Web browser to visit different websites to extract data about the Mission To Mars

## Apply the web scraping technique
we use the flask app to write different routes to run the Mission to Mars. Also, we used the HTML index to create a web page that woould automatically obtain information requested form the Mission to Mars. 

## Module challenge
As I progressed through the first tier of the module, many of my tools were not working. Thus, I had to create a practice folder to run my trials and errors. Plus, some of these apps needed to be re-installed muliple times to in order to complete the module. That said, this is a module that requires a lot of attention to details, as indenting caused a lot of trouble shooting sessions.
